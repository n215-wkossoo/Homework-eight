    <h1>What is Formula 1?</h1>
    As the highest class of international racing for
    single-seater formula racing cars, Formula 1 is the
    pinnacle of motorsport and the world’s most
    prestigious motor racing competition. There really
    is nothing like it. It’s a team sport (it needs to
    be to change all 4 tyres on a car in under 2
    seconds!), but the drivers are more like fighter
    pilots than sportspeople. Battling extreme
    g-forces, making daring decisions in the blink of
    an eye – and at 370km/h. To be the best, F1 drivers
    push themselves – and their incredibly innovative
    machines – to the very limit.

    <h2>Helmets</h2>
    Helmets are compulsory in F1 races. Their built is
    very strong and light so that it doesn’t add extra
    weight on driver’s head at high speeds. These are
    fire resistant also. Of course, the helmets have to
    meet FIA standards.

    <h2>Clothing</h2>
    The clothing of F1 drivers is designed to protect
    them from fire accidents in case of crash. It is a
    multilayered suit that matches specifications of
    NASA. Nomex is the latest fiber material brand used
    to build suits for F1 drivers. The suit undergoes
    thermal testing; it is fire resistant and
    lightweight.
