    <h2>Formula One-Racing</h2>
    Formula 1 racing originated during the 1920-30s in
    Europe from other similar racing competitions. In
    1946, the FIA standardized racing rules and this
    formed the basis of Formula One racing. The
    inaugural Formula One World Drivers’ championship
    was then held in 1950, the first world championship
    series. Apart from the world championship series,
    many other non-championship F1 races were also
    held, but as the costs of conducting these contests
    got higher, such races were discontinued after
    1983. Each F1 team can have maximum of four drivers
    per season. There is support staff with every F1
    team that plays a vital role in the team’s success
