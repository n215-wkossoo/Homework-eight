    <h2>Top Best Racing Circuts In 2023</h2>
    As Formula 1 prepares to embark on its longest-ever
    season (24 races in 2023!) with exciting new
    destinations like Miami and Las Vegas joining the
    ranks of host cities, it’s worth remembering that
    the sport still visits many of its most historic
    and iconic circuits. In fact, four of the seven
    circuits Formula 1 raced on during the first year
    of the modern World Championship in 1950 -
    Silverstone, Circuit de Monaco, Circuit de
    Spa-Francorchamps and Autodromo Nazionale Monza -
    are still part of the calendar in 2023!

    <h3>1. Autodromo Nazionale Di Monza</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="stadium-info">
    The oldest circuit on the Formula 1 calendar turned
    100 years old this year! The city park circuit on
    the outskirts of Milan has hosted a round of the
    modern World Championship every year but one since
    1950. Today’s superfast 5.8km layout retains many
    of the original corners from back then, though the
    banked oval section hasn’t been used since 1961.
    The scene of so many historic victories over the
    years, Monza retains a special place in the hearts
    of F1 fans, especially the ‘Tifosi’ of Ferrari. Why
    go? Electric atmosphere; stunning location in the
    heart of a large city park with easy access to the
    food, culture and history of Milan.

    <h3>2. Circuit De Monaco</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="stadium-info">
    Opened in 1929, Circuit de Monaco has always been
    an unlikely and impractical venue for top-flight
    motor racing. Yet the race in the tiny principality
    on the French Riviera remains one of Formula 1’s
    blue ribbon events, even though wheel-to-wheel
    racing is a little trickier given the increase in
    F1 car size over the years. Despite its
    limitations, Circuit de Monaco remains hugely
    challenging for drivers and an incredible spectacle
    for those fortunate enough to attend. Why go?
    Glamour, super yachts, people-watching and the
    chance to see modern F1 cars on the ragged edge at
    very close quarters

    <h3>3. Silverstone</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="stadium-info">
    Built on the site of a World War II airstrip,
    Silverstone was opened in 1948 and held the first
    race of the modern Formula 1 World Championship two
    years later with King George VI in attendance.
    Despite being rather flat and featureless, the fast
    and flowing circuit in the English countryside has
    delivered many of Formula 1’s most exciting races
    over the years. Firmly established as the sole host
    of the British Grand Prix since the late 1980s,
    Silverstone remains a supreme test of drivers’
    skills and is also one of the best-attended races
    on the entire calendar. Why go? Passionate and
    knowledgeable local fans, friendly atmosphere and
    an action-packed event schedule, on and off the
    track.

    <h3>4. Circuit De Spa-Francorchamps</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="stadium-info">
    The ultimate test of a driver’s skills and nerve,
    the original Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps comprised
    15km of hilly public roads in the Ardennes
    mountains. The circuit hosted the Belgian Grand
    Prix for the first time in 1925 and has remained a
    part of the F1 calendar since the advent of the
    modern World Championship in 1950. Safety concerns
    have been a recurring theme at Spa-Francorchamps,
    which was finally shortened to its current 7km
    layout in 1981, but not before it briefly lost its
    place on the calendar.

    <h3>5. Circuit Gilles Villeneuve</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="stadium-info">
    On a cold day in October 1978, Quebec native Gilles
    Villeneuve took a hugely popular victory in the
    inaugural Canadian Grand Prix at the Île Notre-Dame
    Circuit. Built on a man-made island in the Saint
    Lawrence Seaway close to downtown Montréal, the
    circuit was renamed in honour of Villeneuve after a
    tragic accident claimed the Ferrari driver’s life
    at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. An almost constant
    presence on the calendar for more than 40 years,
    Circuit Gilles Villeneuve has produced many
    memorable races over the years, including popular
    one-off victories for Jean Alesi (1995) and Robert
    Kubica (2008), and an extraordinary last-to-first
    win in treacherous wet conditions for Jenson Button
    in 2011
